            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>YOU are a people whom the Lord hath honoured with many successive able Pastors, Mr. <hi>Obadiah Sedgwick,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sams:</hi> All which Lights the Lord hath taken up into his upper Chamber, after their shine upon Earth to shine in Heaven; after their Labours with men, to take their rest in the Bosom of their God and Saviour. You are a people whom the Lord hath preserved marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously in the stormy, cloudy and dark daies that scattered many others. You have had but a few drops of those tempestuous showers that drowned others. A garden inclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have you been: Your bow yet abideth in strength, though I am well aware how the Archers of Hell and Earth have shot at you. You have seen the goings of God in your Sanctuary, and every one of you may speak of his glory. The Lord hath
<pb facs="tcp:42131:3"/> much thinned your glory and comfort, by the decease of many Principal Members, though after the fall of the leaf, you have had sweet after-springs, and budding stems that you remain as green Olive-trees, in the house of your God: So let his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual glory remain fresh upon you. You have continued in a close adherence to the Lord, and his Worship, not mixing with the world, and thereby have lost little: in your keeping the word of his patience, he hath kept you from the hour of temptation that hath tryed the Earth, when greater damage hath attached others in their neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral, treacherous compliances. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Cloud and fire, hath given you a safe conduct to this present break-day of the Glory of God, and the Jubile of rest and liberty, universally extended in this Nation from its Bondage, and where is the fury of the Oppressor? The Lord cause this springing glory to shine to a perfect day, and prevent new darkening Clouds For above the space of fourteen years the Lord hath placed me, unworthy me among you: And to the praise of his glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious name, you have seen the working of his blessed Spirit in your confirmation and others conversion: In which years
<pb facs="tcp:42131:3"/> through the various tryals Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath exercised me with, and the many personal infirmities that have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, you have born up in your Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ingenuous respects to me, as also in your assistance, according to your abilities, to my civil expences, wherein I have yearly spent the whole revenue of my little Own that I had in this world, which had not been, but for the failure of some other hand, of what was at first proffered at my coming to you; though the disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exigences of late times, conduced much to that failure: This indeed in some fits of exigence, hath proved some little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie temptation to me, to think of some other supply: Which at present I wave in duty to God, and true love to you. The last blow the Lord gave us, was that deep one, by the decease of our dear and honoured Brother Mr. <hi>Hubbard,</hi> which becomes the occasion of this small book. He was a good Copy, I hope many will write after him, and not let that goodly picture drop out of their hearts or lives: He gave you good conduct in all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and prospered, for the Lord was with him: 'Twas amongst his very last words, the Lord hath the residue of Spirits, let
<pb facs="tcp:42131:4"/> us pray that that living, flowing, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit may flourish among us, with the encrease of Gifts and Grace. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my many occasions, some months are pass'd since this Christian deceased; but I remember <hi>Vespasians</hi> Motto on his coin, <hi>sat cito si sat bene.</hi> 'Tis soon enough, if well enough. I design not many words to you, 'twill be better, that what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Glory of God and our mutual comfort, be expressed in our continued fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship. So, finally Brethren, Farewell, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, Live in Peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.</p>

            <p>THE Nation is too ingenious to be imposed upon by a precarious, aiery, fallacious insinuation in telling it, this and that Book was extorted and squeezed out, by the mighty enforcements of others perswasions; and knows well enough what men mean by their annihilations of self-worth, and abilities oft designed as a stirrup, or foot-stool to their greater repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that beauty may ray out the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through a thin cypress veil: It also knoweth when it hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, fruitless flourishes, instead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching treasure, being able to distinguish 'twixt a flood of words and a drop of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 'twixt an wholesome dish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourishing
<pb facs="tcp:42131:5"/> farcements. And I know well what a surcharging Plethory and Surfet the stomach hath by many Books; and how little fear can be of a vacuity in an Age, so richly furnished with all sorts of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as also how short lived Books, long in conception are, much like that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Historian Creature, but of one daies Life, dying as soon as bred, or like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, springing up in one day and withered in the next: And sometime I was thinking what <hi>Saul</hi> did among the Prophets, what <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> did medling in Prophetical matters: And again thought of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> who sent his Servant a Box o'the Ear, for walking between two Senators. This, Reader, I have to tell thee, whatever inducements I had to this small Book, where presumption and imperfection are met together, my Principal reason was, I being a debtor to God and man, to make some thankful Recognition of my Creators mercy, raising me from a low degree to be put in trust with the dispensation of his
<pb facs="tcp:42131:5"/> most Glorious Gospel, as also to tell those of the World that know me, and have been kind to me; that I am desirous, as Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude binds me, to be thankful, and if the Lord favour me, to add one poor mite to their edification in that faith, and love that is in Jesus. I row but in a small bottom, and liking the valleys, hope to escape the blasts and torturings of proud Envy: And whereas an artificial daubing paint as a slovenly dress, are both an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairment of a well complexioned constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose native simplicity is its own best Ornament, I have shun'd both so far as I could. 'Tis mans duty <hi>sui saeculi felicitatem &amp; infelicitatem sapere,</hi> to take some cognisance of the good or evil, of the daies he lives in, and finding the whole universe concern'd in some beneficial service, my dull drowsie Soul began to forget its torpose and inability; as the beggar did his lameness, running away without his Crutches, when the Souldiers brake into the Temple. In this small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I have laboured no big words that
<pb facs="tcp:42131:6"/> exceed the bores of common Ears, nor long spun sentences that snap in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle before the memory can wind up one half: If thy charitable reception and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation may help towards any edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Glory be to the Father Son and holy Ghost.

What was but supposed of other Conquerors, is true of this Black Prince, the whole world must yield to its over-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword, and puissant Mace. It is like Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, made without fear, beholdeth all high things, and is King over all the Children of Pride: Like the War-horse, it paweth in the Valley, and rejoyceth in its strength; it goeth on to meet the armed man; it mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the Sword, and saith among the Trumpets, Ha, Ha.

The Butler and Baker came both out of Prison, the one to Promotion, the other to Execution. Two men are unstrip'd, one to be scourged, the other to be cloathed with new costly Apparel.</p>
            <p>This universal mutability <hi>Israel</hi> confirms, <hi>Behold I Die, but God shall be with you. Joseph</hi> had sent him Chariots to fetch him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and God was sending Chariots to fetch him

This sound certainly more brake their hearts than <hi>Paul</hi>'s did the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ye shall see my face no more.</hi> I your Father, a Patriarch, a Prophet, the Feoffee of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>I Die;</hi> every word doubtless made their hearts to bleed, and the fountains of their eyes to gush out with tears.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An awakening Herauld, <hi>Behold;</hi> a word to quicken attention and consideration, <hi>q. d.</hi> mind the stroke, and consider what you have to do: I put off my Harness, you must put it on. I have fought my good fight, run my race, yours is yet to come; your present loss is great, future storms and calamities more, therefore <hi>Behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A word of Faith, and comfort, <hi>But God shall be with you.</hi> The cold Winter calls
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42131:8"/> for a good fire: The dark Night for lighted Candles, Tempests for Anchors, swoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fits for Cordials, and Distressing Times for an encouraged Active Faith, else Prayer fainteth, Duty sinketh, Enemies Spirits get up, and Holy Hearts drop down. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Shield, envenomed deadly shafts pierce the Soul, congealed Blood freezeth into a crusty benummed Ice, a man is like a Soul-less body, a Ship without Sails, a Boat without Oars, <hi>Janua sine cardine,</hi> quite off the hooks. As Christ, the night in which he was betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the refreshing Supper; So this good man after an holy useful life fortifies, like a good Physician, with a Soveraign <hi>Elixir,</hi> the hearts of his fainting Posterity: <hi>But God shall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like a Wax-candle he expireth with a sweet savour of Prayer, Counsel and Comfort, drops the sweet Ointment from his head to the beard and Skirts. So did <hi>Isaac</hi> before in his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Extasie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Elijah</hi> ascending dropt his Mantle of blessing. <hi>Paul</hi> nigh his departure takes care of the Church, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. And blessed Jesus left this World blessing his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 51. <hi>In rogo Imperatorum,</hi> in burning the dead bodies of Emperors, perfumes were used. <hi>Morientium mens oculatissima,</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men see best; the setting Sun shines fullest. <hi>Bucholcer</hi> that excelled others, at his last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42131:9"/> when led up by two excelled himself. <hi>Bolton</hi> dies preaching on the joys of Heaven. <hi>Preston</hi> on Gods glorious Attributes. Old <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> breaths out a sweet Swan-like Song; the Candle nigh extinct hath the greater flame. <hi>Moses</hi> near dying unrakes the covered fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks the face of the Good will of him that dwelt in the Bush, of which matter little had been said before. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had travell'd over the joys of the whole World, the people gathering about him to hear what news he brought after his return to God, preacheth this lesson, <hi>Vanity of Vanity, all is Vanity,</hi> lest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should venture into his misguiding paths. Old <hi>Israel</hi> after his long earthly Pilgrimage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, reports this good news and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>But God shall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith is a great Prophetess; it sees best at midnight, sings sweetest sitting on a grave, or as the Nightingal with a thorn at its breast, or with <hi>Jonah</hi> in a dark Chappel like the Belly of Hell: it makes the sweetest Musick over Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it findeth Honey in the Lions carcase, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Grapes of Thorns: Like the good Wife riseth at midnight to give Bread to its Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. In a gloomy night it tells of a fair day. <hi>Nube solet pulsâ candidus ire dies,</hi> when death gathers apace to the Heart, the Curtain's drawn, the Coffin ready, and dying knell rung out,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42131:9"/> though laughed at, as Christ attempting to raise the Rulers Daughter, it prophesieth life, saying, <hi>she is not dead, but sleepeth.</hi> Like the Admiral Ship it carries the light in a dark night: if hungry with the Lepers, 'twill venture into the Enemies Camp, and conclude as the good Spies, they are Bread for us: If in danger 'twill have a Victory, though as <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer, it creeps amidst the rocks, on hands, and knees; 'twill rap at Gods doors, though he saith, He and his Children are in Bed: though it sees Cities walled up to Heaven, it hath Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns to batter all down: It minds not delays, or denials, but grows more importunate, and turns stones cast at it into Bread, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 27. Like the Ball cast down rebounds the higher: Like the Smiths fire becomes more intense by the sprinkled water, or as Spring water, 'tis warmest in the Icy Winter. It knows no impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities though all seems desperate, <hi>cum res rediit ad Triarios,</hi> it can live like a Salamander in flames, and like the triumphant Ark disdain the swelling waves. In this manner our <hi>Israel,</hi> with a confiding erect Faith, like a double-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Janus</hi> looking backward and forward, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth that all would do well, though he died. <hi>Nondum omnium dierum soles occiderunt.</hi> Though I a Star of the greatest magnitude am setting, yet the Sun will arise and shine upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42131:10"/> you. <hi>Behold I die, but God shall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. From this report of himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That the most Godly and Useful Saints must dye; <hi>Your Fathers where are they?</hi> Death is not onely the Tribute and Homage of sinful humane nature in general, but of the best of men. The bravest Ships that sail on this Sea must strike and lower their Top-sails to its Flag: The green as the dry Tree must yield to its Axe: The Flower and its goodliness must fade, fine Grass as course, painted as plain. Grace freeth the Soul from moral corruption, not the Body from mortal corruption, from sins eternal condemnation, not from its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral execution. The Sheriff and the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prisoner ride in the same road, though not for the same end. The best must go through this dark dirty Lane, over this stormy Causey to get to the Royal City; the Countrey house of the Body must down that the Soul may go to its City-house. All must come under the stroke of the Angels Sword to get again into Paradise; must feel the pains of death, before they feel the comforts of life; must die to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture e're they live in glory: The Lamp and Candle of Nature must be burnt out, before the Lamp of Glory be lighted: The Phaenix must be burnt to ashes to generate a new Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring. Two deaths must be undergone to get
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42131:10"/> to Heaven, the death of the Body, and the death of Sin. Death is the Bridge 'twixt Time and Eternity. All must uncloath; it would not do well to put the Vestment of Glory over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures course, russet suit.</p>
            <p>Here first consider what <hi>Israel</hi>'s voice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the voice of a diligent Labourer, who had finished his work, and had nothing to do but to die; who had with <hi>David</hi> served his generation served out his Apprentiship; <hi>I have finished the work,</hi> saith blessed Jesus, <hi>which thou gavest me to do. It is finished, and he bowed the head and gave up the Ghost, John</hi> 17. 4. and 19. 30. The idle truanting Child is loth to see the Father's face. Rest is sweet to the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, not to the Loiterer. Work dispatched, a man dies with his own consent. The good Wife having got all ready, hath nothing to do, but to welcom her Husband long longed for. <hi>Israel</hi> could <hi>feriari Deo,</hi> keep holy-day with his God: His Ship was laded and rigged wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for Wind and Tide. After many field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battels he had only to put on the incorruptible Crown of glory, and after his labour in the Vineyard to take his golden penny. A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward is glad of his Audit, waiting only his discharge, and Plaudit, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant:</hi> He had not now to believe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42131:11"/> repent, and make his peace: He had not so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as to be afraid to die, or to desire to live his life over again. 'Tis the godly life that makes the welcom death. <hi>Aristippus,</hi> in the storm, the Sailors wondering he was not afraid, said, <hi>You fear the torments due to a vicious life, and I expect the rewards of a virtuous life. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar Borgius</hi> was prepared for all things but to die. One, told by the Physician he must die, cryed out, <hi>And how much work have I to do?</hi> Another cryed out, <hi>Wounds, side, heart, must I die?</hi> 'Tis sad to see the Lamp of Nature wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Lamp of Grace not lighted, who are still to repent, still to believe. The comfort of a well-employed life is a great secret, hid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na that none know, but they that have it. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion</hi> thence chode his backward Soul, <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, egredere anima, quid times?</hi> why my Soul dost thou fear who hast served Christ these sixty years? <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis the voice and language of Faith in the Covenant of Grace. The first violated Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant said, <hi>In dying thou shalt die.</hi> Death came double, dissolution to the Body, and damnation to the Soul. The Gospel tells us of a second death, a death unto death, of death and its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower; there is death and its sting, death and the bitterness of death. <hi>Israel</hi> saw but a single disarmed death, <hi>John</hi> 8. 51. <hi>He that believeth</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42131:11"/>
               <hi>shall not tast of death.</hi> The Believer does but just dip his finger in the Vinegar sauce, just sip of the Cup, and pass it away. Justice hath a Cup without mixture, without the least dram or drop of sweetning; and of a Cup full of mixture, tempered with all dreadful ingredients: To Believers all is sweetned, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. that is pale, wan, withering to a sinner, is verdant and refreshing to a Saint: The old enemy is made a friend. <hi>Windelmuta</hi> told, you have not yet tasted death, replyed, nor never shall. Christ hath promised it, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 15. <hi>The wicked are buried in death,</hi> that is, soon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or thus, their Body is buried in the grave, and their Soul in Hell. Faith parts with a life that cannot be kept, and foreseeth a life that cannot be lost. <hi>Democritus,</hi> asked by <hi>Philip,</hi> if he did not fear the loss of his life and head, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>If I do, the</hi> Athenians <hi>can give me a life that is immortal.</hi> Faith puts into the possession of a life that never dies: He had first seen the Basilisk, and knew it could not kill him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis the voice of one willing to die, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at its foresight: He is not startled, nor at all appall'd; shews no regret or recoiling thoughts; the blood in his face made no retreat for fear; he had more acquaintance with God than to be afraid: Though he felt a weak Body, he found a strong Faith; he knew though his Body
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42131:12"/> was going to the Land of darkness as darkness its self, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 22. that his Soul was going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting light: The Body with its dark black Mantle goes to an house where are all black hangings, but the Soul in her purled works and bright embroideries goes into the King's Palace with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ss. <hi>Israel</hi> joyed before at the Waggons that fetched him from an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Famine, and now at God's Waggon to carry him to an heavenly Feast. <hi>Nautae dulcia patriis oscula figunt littoribus.</hi> The Sea-men kiss and leap on the wish'd for Shoar. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> cryed, <hi>How shall I be willing to live?</hi> What Nature loaths and abhorreth, Grace dearly loveth. Death's paleness is better than the purest beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Cato</hi> so died, <hi>ut causam moriendi se nactum esse gaudeat,</hi> that he had obtained the occasion of dying. <hi>Cyprian</hi> received the sentence with a <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> thanks be to God, take me from men, return me to my Master. <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into the mysteries of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> hearing that all of that Religion were happy, said, <hi>Why do they not then die?</hi> Who is loth to go home where most known and knowing? The Sea man gladly goes off the raging Sea <hi>ad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatas insulas.</hi> The Soldier after many bloody battels is glad of his <hi>quietus est,</hi> of his quiet and well-provisioned winter-quarters. Is a Prisoner loth to be unfettered? the Bird to be out of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42131:12"/> the Cage? the poor man to put off his raggs for princely Robes? Saints have death in desire, life in tolerance. Sinners have life in desire, and death in tolerance, because they cannot avoid it. Knowing God is reconciled, and that they are getting out of sins, Satans, and sinners hands, finding Conscience serene, what should make them unwilling or undesirous? The Prince is glad of his gaudy Inauguration; the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his splendid Triumph. <hi>Frederick</hi> the third <hi>Elect. Palat.</hi> said to his Friends wishing his recovery, <hi>I have lived enough to you, let me now live for my self, and with my Lord Christ.</hi> 'Tis he who fears death that will not live with Jesus. Homely Messengers are received with respects for their Masters and Errands sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Israel</hi> saw the grim Servant on his pale Horse, he felt him knocking with his black Rod at Natures door, beheld his commanding Mace requiring his appearance to the King of Kings, yet his Heart could meditate terrour, digest the thoughts of all without terror, as the Ostrich can digest Iron. He knew his Master and his Errand, and could freely step up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him to be carried to a better Place, better Relations, to Christ the Mediator, and the innumerable company of Angels. <hi>Socrates</hi> was glad dying he should see <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod,</hi> and other brave Philosophers; adding, 'twould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42131:13"/> be sad to die, if not going to better Company than he left behind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Israel</hi> had sent out Scouts to acquaint him with the Enemies strength and intent, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Siege with his Granadoes to batter down his Clay walls, and like a valiant Souldier does not stay till the Enemy came up to him, but went out to meet and fight him. He had heard the Cocks crowing, and the Clocks giving warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that 'twas high time to arise, and be gone: He saw his Voyage nigh ended, and the Tide coming, and so with joy hoyseth up his Sails. Evangelick <hi>Job</hi> cries out, <hi>I know my Redeemer liveth;</hi> and familiarly talks of his Kindred, <hi>I have said to corruption, thou art my Father, to the Worm, thou art my Mother and my Sister, Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. The Child is not afraid to behold its Father, Mother, or Sister. 'Tis said of <hi>Moses</hi> that he died with Gods kiss, <hi>ad os Dei:</hi> the Babe kissed with its Mothers smiling face quietly lies down. Who should be loth to go to a place where are all Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, those <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>? as <hi>Naz.</hi> calls them, speaking of his Sister <hi>Gorgonias</hi> death: Hence that expostulation, <hi>pati timetis, exire non vultis, quid faciam?</hi> Ye are loth to suffer, and loth to be gone, what shall I do? The Antient Primitive Church waiteth for you, the Saints desire you.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42131:13"/> 4. 'Tis the voice of one peaceably resigning and submitting, ready to make a well-pleased re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery of the Soul which God had given him, knowing he received it on those terms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it upon demand. <hi>Aaron</hi> was silent. Christ <hi>before the shearers was dumb, he opened not his mouth:</hi> He did not repine, murmur, or rage, as that Marshal <hi>Biron;</hi> he did not flie at, and gnaw the stone cast at him: He did not draw at the Arrest of Gods Serjeant: <hi>Tiribazus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> drew his Sword, but hearing it was an Arrest from the King, he put it up and submitted: Shall I not, saith patient bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jesus, drink the cup my heavenly father giveth me to drink? To a Believer 'tis <hi>Calix,</hi> not <hi>Cadus,</hi> a cup, not an hegs-head; 'tis a cup that smells of the fathers hand, the dregs whereof the wicked shall drink. He did not quarrel or strive to escape deaths hands: He kissed the black rod, yields to Gods Mace, without any harsh resentments, he gives quiet and full seizin, saying, 'tis the Lord, let him do as seemeth him good. <hi>Non tamen abhorruit anima à corpore,</hi> he was not displeased with, or weary of his old yoak fellow: He knew his Soul and Body married to part, and that they also should meet again: The Body saith to the Soul, like a man lying down to sleep, farewell, my Dear, till the morning; the Soul
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42131:14"/> saith to the Body, as a man going a long voyage, My Dear, farewell, but after a few months I purpose to return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Israel</hi> doth not capitulate or proffer terms for a renewed lease, but is willing to give in his old, willing to exchange his rural Cottage, for a royal Palace, his dark, narrow house for one more large, lightsome, and commodious: The Musician is willing to change his worn, cracked, unstringed instrument for a new one: So the Seaman, to exchange his crazy weather-beaten ship, for one new and strongly built. He knew his times to be in Gods hand and dispose: <hi>Socrates</hi> dying said to his friends, that the Gods only knew whether 'twere better for him to live or die. He was not <hi>dubiae juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis</hi> 'twixt the Collisions of Faith and Fear, but could say as <hi>Paul, I know whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep what I have committed to him.</hi> The Child is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put the precious jewel into its Fathers hands, to be safely laid up in his Cabinet for it. He saw death flying to him, as a Dove with an Olive Branch of peace, and not like an Eagle to make a prey of him. He saw it a Friend to invite home, not as an Enemy or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevant of offended, avenging justice; as a Ferry Boat to waft Gods children over to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42131:14"/>
            <p> The sinner would fain flee out of his hand, <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 22. he believes he shall not return out of darkness, he feels scaring hellish flashes in conscience; sees the black Dog in his Chamber: Looking backward, he beholds a dismal train of lies and oaths, and a sinful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable life: Looking forward, he hath the prospect of eternal fiery flames; looking inward, there is an hellish heap of sin, and a wounded gnawing conscience; looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, there is an holy incensed Almighty God: There is <hi>a dreadful sound in his ears,</hi> the ratling of Hells Chains, and the smell of its loathsome sulphur is in his nose, the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of the fiery lake oft scorch him; Spectrums and Apparitions affright him, much he feels, worse he fears: <hi>Animula blandula quò vadis.</hi> And I saith <hi>Reuben,</hi> whither shall I go. <hi>Hinc transeundum, quò abeundum. Rebekah</hi> asked, <hi>Wilt thou go with this man?</hi> answered; <hi>I will go:</hi> A Believer is willing to go along with death, but the sinner knows 'twill bind him, and carry whither he would not go. Dying is an act of obedience, not to be performed by children of disobedience; he that hath no grace in his life, can have no peace at death. 'Tis the oyl of grace that generates the oyl of gladness: The noise of the doleful funeral knell, the sight of the Beir or Scull, an hours sitting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42131:15"/> by a dead ghastly body appalls them. <hi>Saul</hi> that had a Lions heart, fainteth away: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi> though his concubines and cups were at hand, grows wan, trembles and his joynts knock against one another: <hi>Ahab</hi> droops and hangs his feathers, <hi>Nabal</hi> is sullen like a stone, <hi>Judas</hi> bursts asunder: <hi>Cur hoc quod p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Death is so terrible that men yield to the greatest miseries, mutilations, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrings, and cauterisings, yea venture to kill their Souls, to save their Bodies; <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi> 'twice casts in incense into the Idol fire,

               <hi>Ecebolius</hi> turns 'twice; even <hi>Peter</hi> denies, and forswears: men will live with maimed bodies, and perjured Souls to protract a short Life.</p>
            <p>Hence in cool blood, and rational delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, every sinner averts from death; death is ever violent, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. <hi>This night thy Soul shall be required of thee;</hi> required, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed: his Soul is haled or forced away, as the Prisoner by the Serjeant, <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 8. as a Sword from a rusty Sheath, or a Cloth eat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flesh, or the Foot from a strait pinching shoe.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Israel,</hi> is serene, calm without any impatient perturbation, a smooth Sea, not desiring respite for a day or an hour: But with <hi>Simeon,</hi> the arms of his Soul and Body filled with Christ, could say, Now Lord lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace; or with <hi>David,</hi> Return, O my Soul, to thy rest. He saw a blessed train of good works, prayers, piety and charity following him; and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels with open arms and acclamations of joy, ready to conduct him into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting rest.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis the voice of one satisfied, undesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of longer living, or of abiding in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fields.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The reasons why Gods <hi>Israel,</hi> or the godly must die.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Israel</hi> must die because there is sin, that cries for the fulfilment of the antient threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>In the day, thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die:</hi> Sin and death are couples, go chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: Death had lain asleep for ever, if not enlivened by sin: The Sithe had had no Edge, if sin had not set it on: It had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born for ever; The Sword had never been drawn out of its Sheath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>James</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> to evade origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sin, will not have it the punishment of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, but <hi>naturalis conditionis consequens,</hi> the consequent of mans natural condition, as made of mortal, brittle materials, tempered with elementary, fading qualities: True 'tis, what God made he can unmake, he can unpin the Tabernacle he sets up; yet his own Almighty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42131:19"/> will, who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, could have preserved these contrary elements from quarrelling upon Earth, as he did in the body of Christ after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Man at first was neither absolutely mortal or immortal, though mortality lay in the condition of nature, yet death was only on the supposition of sin. Man had a <hi>posse peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di &amp; moriendi.</hi> As he might sin, he might die: Humane Nature in <hi>Adam</hi> contracted a debt, and all must be arrested for it: The Blood was tainted to the dammage of the whole Family, though not for satisfaction, yet for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deserved justice: Where the garment is stained and sented with the blood of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, the Blood-hound will fasten▪ Death found sin on a sinless Saviour, and pull'd him down to the grave: All in a measure, though for other ends, must hold conformity to him, and by tasting of death, learn to prize him that came to deliver from death and wrath to come: By this the benefit of Christ is enhaunced; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that attends self-preservation abhors it, and fears the viper though the sting be out, and if not for a Saviours interposure, it had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as at first an enemy and passage to Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The righteous dye that sin may not live. O happy Death! That killest thy self and sin at once. <hi>Goliahs</hi> head is cut off with his own
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42131:20"/> Sword. <hi>Hîc praeceptum non peccare, ibi praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> 'Tis Heavens precept that here we sin not; 'tis Heavens promise and reward that there sin shall be no more, it can't riggle into that heavenly paradise: The Law Vessels were not clean till broke to shivers: The People were unclean till even: The wall was pull'd down to destroy the Leprosy, and the fig-tree <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaks of incorporated into its joynts. Death is the Red-Sea, where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are drown'd, never to be seen more. <hi>Pia proles quae devorat matrem,</hi> sin was the mother of death, the Daughter buryeth the Mother full sore against her own, and the Devils will. Sin comes in at the Marriage of Soul and Body, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts at their divorce: It doth Saints the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to rid them of what they would give worlds to be rid of immediately; on dissolution there is impeccability and impassibility to the Soul, it shall never sin nor suffer more. The <hi>Persians</hi> had an hunting day call'd <hi>vitiorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritum,</hi> for the killing of venemous creatures. Death takes away a sinners Soul, and a Saints sin. <hi>Peccatum erat obstetrix mortis, &amp; mors est sepulchrum peccati.</hi> The Death of the Body delivers from the Body of Death. <hi>Per quod potestatem habuit victum est.</hi> Death is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not as the end of trouble, but as the end of sin: Filthy Garments put off, and White
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42131:20"/> Robes put on. 'Tis sin makes life uneasie: Old Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> said, I have sought death with tears, not from impatience, or perturbation, but as weary of sin, and afraid of falling into it. A Gentlewoman trembl'd at her revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from deaths sentence, because returning to a world where she should sin again. The Grave to the Body shall be as the Fullers Sope, to wash out its stains; and as the Dyers fat to strike in an Orient Dye, into the Souls bridal apparel; in this withdrawing room it shall be new turken'd, and fashioned, fitted for an Eternal Marriage with the Soul and with the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The godly die, that being godly may not hinder them of their chief desires, and truest happiness: Days here are few and evil, 'tis deaths kindness to shorten them: If hope were only in this Life, of all, the Saints were most miserable, because, besides the calamities that are the common appendages of humane nature, they are under special consignations to the Cross for Jesus sake, exposed to the keenest malice, of Men and Devils, because they are Christians. Hence death is put into a Christians inventory of goods, <hi>inter peculia,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. Happy they would be; without this that gives deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and seizin, they cannot be. Blessedness bears date from dying in the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. dying days are the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42131:21"/> of holy Souls: Now Saints are happy, but then all is pure, fixed, and consummate; all is now mixed Wine dashed with Water; Chaff mixed with Wheat, Smoak with Fire, Unbelief with Faith, their Pillar is Cloud and Fire, their day made up of Morn and Even. <hi>Ambigendo confidunt, &amp; confidendo ambigunt,</hi> they doubt and believe; believe and doubt: The Tide is coming and going; The Sun rising and setting: But then all shall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unalterable without shadow of change: The change from Nature to Grace is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I was a Persecutor, I was a Blasphemer: But the change from Grace to Glory is far greater, when Saints shall be so unlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and what they were, that they shall stand amazed at themselves in their new dress, as if they were not the same persons. Religion will do none so much harm as to keep them long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der severe Tutors, Governours and Harsh Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters; or as to keep them long from their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inheritance, and the Bosom of Christ: The greatest demonstration of divine love would be wanting, 'twould for ever dishearten from god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, if men should fare the worse because they are better than others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The godly die, that the Seas of mutual interchangeable loves may meet in one stream, that the Partition Wall 'twixt two Lovers may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42131:21"/> be broken down. Christ and his dear Spouse Love one another too much to be long asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: The Spirit saith, come, the Bride saith, come, come, Lord Jesus, come quickly. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Bowels Yern for <hi>Absolom,</hi> and he longs to see his Fathers Face; a Mediatrix may easily bring both together. Blessed Jesus raiseth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and expectations in holy hearts to enjoy him; his death and prayer in Heaven, is, that they may live together, <hi>John</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that those that thou hast giv'n me be with me;</hi> so saith the Omnipotent Son to the Omnipotent Father, I <hi>will.</hi> He went to Heaven as their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 20. and representatively, they sit in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in him. In Heaven he is to prepare a place for them; shall all this cost and care be lost? <hi>Abraham</hi> rescues his Brother, <hi>David</hi> his Wives; will not the Redeemer rescue his afflicted Spouse? Hath he brought an Inheritance for himself and his Heirs; bequeathed it in his Testament; does he live to be his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and will he not possess his Children with it? The Saints have left all for him, the world is an enemy to them for his sake, their superlative esteem is, <hi>Whom have we in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee?</hi> their cry is, <hi>Lord how long,</hi> why stay thy Chariot Wheels so long? Lord thou hast made us for thee; and our heart is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42131:22"/> unquiet till with thee: We can put into no other harbour, <hi>when shall we appear before thee?</hi> Surely nothing shall long keep apart these dear and Ardent Lovers, where the exile of either is a wound to both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The godly must die to make room for godly successors. There is not room enough on the narrow table of this world at once for Gods Plate to stand upon: Many are to Act their part on the Stage, and some must go off. Many Stars are to arise and Shine, some must set. <hi>One generation passeth, and another cometh, Eccles.</hi> 1. 4. all Gods Children can't be hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up in one room. One shall not do all the work, nor bear all the glory, or golden pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; some are to come in at the third, others at the sixth, at the ninth, at the eleventh hour. One shall not fight all the Lords Battels, and carry away the triumph: <hi>Ferdinand</hi> said, How had I been Emperour if my Ancestors had not died? And I must die to make room for others. The Lord orders that some of <hi>Moses</hi> honour should be put upon <hi>Joshua, Num.</hi> 27. 19, 20. <hi>Elijah</hi> ascends out of sight, and drops his Mantle on <hi>Elisha, David</hi> prepares and makes room for <hi>Solomon, John</hi> admits a veil that Christ might shine, abates his trade and leaves his Customers to a worthier hand: Princes call home one Embassadour to send out another:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42131:22"/> Christ himself steps aside to make way for the Spirit. Saints shall go Sharers in Work and Wages, that all may rejoyce together, and one without the other may not be perfect, <hi>John</hi> 4. 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 40.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Israel,</hi> the godly must die to reap the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest of Christs and their own labours. Shall the great price of Christs blood be shed in waste? Shall he make preparations in Heaven, &amp; in the heart, to make meet for a blessed estate, in vain? <hi>John</hi> 14. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. Shall a Mother endure hard labour, and not have the pleasure to fill her arms with her Child, and to dandle it at her Breasts? What will become of the Fathers promise, <hi>he shall see of the Travel of his Soul and shall be satisfyed?</hi> Shall he plant a Vineyard, and not Eat of the Fruit? Tread the Olives and not be anointed with Oyl?</p>
               <p>Shall Christians labour in vain? Plough and sow in tears, and not reap the sheaves of joy? Shall they sigh and not sing? Pray and not Praise? Shall Corn be sown and shule in the Fields?</p>

               <p>When mercies are wanting Saints have the Keys of Heaven to open, of Hell to shut up, of the Grave and of the Womb. <hi>Elijah</hi> had the Keys to unlock and Bar up the Clouds.

These are a Nations Riches, <hi>deliciae Christi, divitiae mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, Hos.</hi> 2. 23. The loss is great, when hundreds and thousands are withdrawn from the publick stock.</p>
               <p>In Arduous Exigencies Saints are the best Comforters and Counsellers: The Admirals that carry the Lights in a dark night. <hi>Saul</hi>'s Servant tells his Master at a loss for the Asses, of a man of God, an honourable man

These can guide in untrode paths when bewildred, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do; can steer the Ship in a stormy night, interpret dark Texts of Providence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle its mysteries, can strengthen sad hearts, and asswage grief by their moving lips, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 18. <hi>They were wont to speake in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at</hi> Abel, <hi>and so they ended the matter.</hi> These are the true <hi>Abel,</hi> the City of wise men that have the Tongue of the Learned, beyond <hi>Ahitophel</hi> for Oracles of wisdom.</p>
               <p>In all great Affairs in Church or State, none are like these; seldom does the Lord any thing without them, or but for their sakes.</p>
               <p>In Civil Affairs, who like <hi>Joseph, Mordecai, Daniel?</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> took men of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirit from the Plough and Turnip-gardens to conduct Armies. 'Tis a sollicism in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that is, <hi>alicujus excellentiae testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> an indication of worth, when worthy men <hi>imperio digni,</hi> fit to be at Helm, live and die in obscurity; and wicked men, <hi>servire dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In Church Affairs none like holy men. The Jews say the Keys of the Temple were laid at night under <hi>Solomons</hi> head: they had need lye under a wisemans head. <hi>Difficilis est tractatio alienae conscientiae,</hi> medling with Conscience is a great Art. The Hebrew Doctors observe that Prophesie rests only on good men: <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> taken a while out of the Devils hand had a rapture but transient.</p>
               <p>Ministerial Vessels are anointed with Oil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 9. Men rowing to Hell will hardly get their passengers to Heaven.

               <p>Nevertheless the Lord hath his Soveraign Prerogative Liberty to make use of bad men. The workman is the better Artist that can work well with bad Tools. The Lord will convince Saints, that he can rule the world without them, and shame such, as when in place corrupted themselves, and warped from the integrity of their interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> is among the Prophets. <hi>Cyrus</hi> is Gods Shepherd. Ravens feed <hi>Elijah,</hi> and oft good seed is sown with a dirty hand. And as the Fowls of the Air take shelter in the Boughs of the grain of Mustard-seed grown to a Tree; so carnal men have been a Sanctuary to Gods people; leaves are defensive to the fruit, the chaffy husk to the Corn, the thorn Hedge to the fruitful Field, and the Mud-wall to the Garden. The Lord can work straight with a crooked rule.</p>

The Spirit of invincible grace and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience could not be conquered in Christ's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, but went from one to another, as <hi>Elijah</hi>'s to <hi>Elisha,</hi> not in the least shew of abhorred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42131:44"/> but in the just asserting of the Truth of God, that is more precious than life, yea than all the world. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, though he were in bonds, the word was not bound. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sing in Prison. The Apostles at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, boldly Preached Christ in the Temple. After three days and an half, the Spirit of life from God entred into the slain Witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. Belonging to the exercise of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are the Wheels, the living creatures, and the Spirit: The old Wheels may be worn, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or broken, but the Eternal Divine Spirit remains, that can yoke new living creatures, and put on fresh Wheels. This Spirit shall drive away the Fowls that would eat up <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Sacrifice; the black Crows, the white and black Pies that thought to make Carrion of it. The Standard of the Spirit, the Lord promiseth to oppose or obstruct the Enemy pouring in like a flood, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 19. by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a perverse entangled Spirit in the Churches Enemies, or otherwise counterpoising them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>According to the word, that I cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with you when ye came out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>so my Spirit remaineth among you; Fear ye not.</hi> Be that word the Lord's inviolable promise, or Christ the essential word, the word [according] not being in the Original, and may be rendred <hi>in quo vobiscum pepigi,</hi> I am with you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42131:44"/> with that word, in whom I covenanted with you when ye came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> 'Tis an assurance of the Divine Spirit, and indeed the whole Trinity, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Word and the Spirit the next Operator, stand engaged for the Churches deliverance, and 'twas <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord,</hi> that <hi>Zorobabel</hi> shall prosper. This Spirit the Father put upon Christ for the dispatch of his work, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1. And the pourings out of it are the great pledges of the Church's rest and glory, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of</hi> Israel. This was that Spirit that gave favour to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Jews in the sight of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> to encourage them to set up the house of God, and to repair the desolations thereof. This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enlivens the ten Horns upon the Beast to hate the Whore, to make her desolate, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and to burn her with fire. This Spirit makes Kings Nursing Fathers, and Queens Nursing Mothers, and to bring in their glory to the City of God. When the Lord breathed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s earthly Mass the breath of life, he became a living Soul, vigorous and active, who was before but a dead lump. When the Sun returns with its enlivening Spring force, the Earth is turned as Clay to the Seal, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42131:45"/> the imprintings of its glory: And they stand up as a garment, that is, the hid plants and flowers stand up with a thousand gay beauties, like an embroidered garment. What admirable variegated beauties hath the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow by the strike of the Sun? Such like glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shall the Spirit impress on the hearts and lives of men, who shall be changed from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory as by the Spirit. This Spirit raised up the peoples spirit at <hi>Cyrus</hi> order to go forth to build the Lord's house, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 5. and with the Lord is the <hi>Residue of Spirits.</hi>

We shall not die:</hi> O Lord thou hast ordained them for Judgment; and, O mighty God thou hast established them for correction; not for destruction. <hi>Joseph</hi> was thought to be slain by his bloodied Coat,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42131:45"/> yet had a flourishing Life in <hi>Egypt;</hi> though 'twas no likely Soil for the Plants of Paradise to thrive in: The Billows and the Waves pass over <hi>Jonah,</hi> the depths close him about, the weeds wrap about his head, down he goes to the Bottom of the Mountains, the Earth with her Bars was about him for ever, yet the Lord brought up his Life from corruption: Being hard of digestion the Whale vomits him up: The retreated sap and tide return. If the Sun sets, or goes back ten Degrees it shineth again. Creatures that lye benummed, cramped all Winter, having only a little blood to keep Life, in the Spring recover vigour.</p>
               <p>Some die but go not under so many Degrees of Death. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was far gone, By this time he stinketh, and the Captives in <hi>Babylon</hi> become dry Bones, the vital <hi>Succus</hi> spent: The Churches Death is but <gap reason="foreign">

The Spark under ashes gets into a flame, <hi>Isai.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Thy dead men shall live,</hi>

Divinity is strong, though flesh be consumed, no Breath or Pulse to be observed, yet <hi>Israels</hi> dry Bones live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. Rabbi <hi>Juda</hi> would have it meant that literally <hi>Ezekiel</hi> raised the dead, and that they went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and bore Children saying, <hi>Ego sum oriundus ex posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate illorum quos Ezekiel in vitam revocavit,</hi> that he was one of that posterity. A like fancy the <hi>Jews</hi> have that the scattered of <hi>Israel</hi> shall come <hi>per meatus terrae,</hi> through the pores of the Earth to their own Land. This is certain, the Lord will do things seeming impossible in restoring his Church to Life.</p>
               <p>And this way of delivering from sentences of death, <hi>à morte ad vitam,</hi> is most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God, and for his People, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections will be glorious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42.

               <p>And the Lord is sworn to his People accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Oath that he made when they came out of <hi>Egypt, Hag.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments unto a thousand generations;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payeth them that hate him, to their face to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them. <hi>Jacob</hi> may in a fitt say, <hi>The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.</hi> Enemies may say, They are entangled, they are bread for us, there is no help for them in God: But a Mother may sooner forget her sucking Child, that is dearest, and drawing out her very bowels, than God can forget his <hi>Jacob.</hi> And suppose the Child be grown up, and be rebellious, yet what Father would disinherit a Child? What Husband would divorce a Wife when they are able, willing, and engaged to remove and cure all in either that is distastful, and to infuse all such winning qualities as may attract and perpetuate love?</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42131:63"/>
               <p> Here one doubt offers its self, as <hi>Rebekah</hi> said, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> or as <hi>Gideon, If the Lord be with us, why is all this befaln us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to this consider, God is then most with his people, when he lets them fall into dangers and into enemies hands, either for their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or for their comfort. God was most with <hi>Abraham</hi> when travelling through the enemies Land; and with <hi>Noah</hi> when the Flood-gates of Heaven and Earth were set open: and with <hi>Israel</hi> in the Red Sea: And with his Servants in the burning Furnace and Lions Den; and with the Martyrs when burning at the Stake: When Seas of joy were poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Say not, God is afar off, now he is nearest, in the Mount of danger, in the Belly of Hell, in the burning Bush, that all are not consumed, and that the Dragons Flood doth not overflow all. When was God more with <hi>Israels</hi> Posterity than when their Bondage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased under an unkind <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> and when was their deliverance nearer? In that doleful perplexed Estate <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 9, 10. Faith could say, <hi>Yet thou art in the midst of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also consider it may be needful for <hi>Israel</hi> that though God remove not his Presence, he should alter his Countenance and Carriage: His Heart is the same, though his Countenance alters. If the Lord did not let distresses come how should
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42131:64"/> the wickedness and rage of the wicked be known, their sin ripened, and their Plagues as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> greatned? How should the Saints corruptions be purged, their graces evidenced, exercised and encreased, and their heavenly glory and crown be brightned? When the Lord is greatly angry with the wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that their time shall be short, he lets loose their rage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. as he dealt with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the hardning of his Heart to his destruction: When the Lord intends, <hi>Zions</hi> glorious Birth-pangs are strong: Birth and Death-pangs are always sharp: If the child be sick, there is need of change of Diet. If it be disorderly, a Rod is best for it: If there be dirt upon <hi>Zion,</hi> there is need of a wisp; and after Gods Plate is scoured, the Rod is cast to the Dunghil.</p>

The Lord taketh my part with them that help me, therefore I shall see my desire on them that hate me, Psal.</hi> 118 6, 7. The Lord hath many Instruments, and many places to fetch them out of: What he does not by one, he will do by another: What he does not at one time, he will do at another. So <hi>Mordecai</hi> told <hi>Esther,</hi> if she were silent, the Lord would deliver from another Place, which term Place is by some reckoned the title of God, meaning, if the creature helped not, God would; witness the <hi>Persian</hi> Princes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 11. and the special Decree of <hi>Darius,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever interrupted his Decree in rebuilding <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> Let Timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</p>

               <p>When the state of things may be desolate, when there are no Physicians, or if any, they ignorant of the disease and cure, or the potion is dashed out of their hand: Men stand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on the shore, fearing the Ship will sink: Death gathering apace to the Heart, complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, purse, breath altered, Relations stand, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, with a dumb silence, with mournful accented voices, the conduits of their eyes running down with tears, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the sick man, he is no man of this World. Well, let the Church be as the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Son on the Bier, or as <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Grave, yet hope with <hi>Abraham</hi> against hope: <hi>Egypt</hi> hath many diseases, and many remedies, <hi>multa venena &amp; multa salubria.</hi> Let diseases be Epidemical or Chronical, <hi>Israel</hi> hath a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician that can cure all: <hi>Etiam opprobria me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum, Jer.</hi> 30. 15, 16. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>The more this foundation truth is believed, the deeper rooting it hath in mens minds, 'twill stop hard thoughts of God, God shall have our good word; it will keep from sin, from irregular means, and traiterous in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; <hi>Mordecai</hi> will not bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> nor conceal Treason; Duty will be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Lastly, In all merciful Providences, make grateful, make glorious ascriptions unto <hi>Israel</hi>'s God. <hi>Job</hi> 12. 9. Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? Upon the defeatment of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <hi>According to this time it shall be said, What hath God wrought? Numb.</hi> 23. 23. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us up quick; their throats are like Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, large and hungry as the grave. All may say, This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. <hi>Moses</hi> makes it the head of his song, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited: <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in power: Thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy, Exod.</hi> 15. 6. When the seven Plagues tempered with the wrath of God were poured out, the victorious Saints, with the Harps of God, sing the Song of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> the Servant of God, and of the Lamb, (they two are at no jarrs) saying, Great and

The Blessed <hi>Mary</hi> falls in with her joyful acclamation, <hi>He that is mighty hath done for me great things, and holy is his name. Ezra,</hi> chap. 9. ver. 8, 9. praiseth God, who had extended mercy to his people in the sight of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> lightning their eyes, giving them a reviving in their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and to set up the House of their God.</p>
               <p>Who but God could divide Seas, turn <hi>Ahito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi> Counsel into Foolishness, hang <hi>Haman</hi> on the Gallows built for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> preserve, Lambs among Lions, Lillies among Thorns suspend the rage of Lions and a fiery Furnace, secure the Ark above the furious Deluge, put an Hook into the Jaws of the Dragon?

            <p>'TIS too common with worthless men to express their pique at vertue, with their venemous mouth to spit poyson, and spray the Face of Beauty, to scratch with their <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> Nails, and with their Blood-shotten eyes to make envious detractions on worthy Persons and their laudable actions, and by immixing <hi>Alchymy</hi> to give a dull allay to finer metals. But the wise shall inherit glory; and the memory of the Righteous shall be Blessed: This made <hi>Demetrius</hi> say, the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> could demolish his statues, but not his Pyramidical vertues.

Men godly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42131:88"/> need no Parasitical Smoak, yet 'twould be a manifest breach of Law, a disingenuous profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, an encouragement of bad men, to pour Fragrant Ointments on a Dung-hill by embla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoning Panegyricks: But good men deserve a bundle of Myrrh and Frank-incense; 'twas acceptable and honourable for <hi>Mary</hi> to pour the Alabaster-Box of very precious Ointment on the nigh dying Body of her dear Redeemer. The Sun setting leaves a Light behind it: When the Spirit came at the name of <hi>Enoch,</hi> it made a pause, and trebled its notes, as the Nightingale quavering on her pleasant Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 21, 24.

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42131:88"/>
               <head>His Temper.</head>
               <p n="1">1. It was smooth, cheerful and well-pleasing, manifest by that usual Commentator his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: This rendered him an acceptable Companion, apt to all offices of Love, and an Ornament to Religion, which yet was a greater Ornament to him. But this cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from his refined sublimated Soul, was most manifested by his Angelick delight in singing Psalms, in which he expressed an internal joy, and was oft dissolved into a mixture of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious Tears, Fragrant as the Dews and drops of Roses distilled over a gentle fire: As also by his Prayers that ascended as sweet odour or incense to Heaven, in his usual magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich unmerited distinguishing grace, and the glorious unutterable priviledges of his dear Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was patient, composed, calm and silent especially at injuries, knowing it to be the greatest and noblest victory to conquer himself: With a grateful mixture of Faith and Patience, he could behold the party-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and variegated Rain-bow of earthly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures. Innocency with the Testimony of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42131:89"/> God and Conscience were shield enough. He knew troubles to be the tribute and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of Humane Nature, yet as a Christian could take them as Pledges of Fatherly Love: Without a Stoical Apathy afflictions did not much damp him; and without an enamoured levity, he could behold the Glitter, Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Musick, and pleasure of the Worlds gaieties that enchaunt others. In case he found any mental jar, mutiny, or insurrection; and if with <hi>Rebekah</hi> by the struglings of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> in her narrow enclosure, he found cause to say, why am I thus? Without amuzement or changing of Countenance, putting all under the domination of reason, in wisdom he could conceal, and by the encounters of grace timely suppress, not suffering the spark to rise up into a flame; yet at some time when sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, he would unburden himself into a faithful friendly Bosom: In the alternate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of this changing world experience prepared him for harsh occurrences, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to be justled in the tumultuous bespatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Croud of this busie world: He would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the Blustering Winds pass on, stepping out of their way, than by opposing make them more outragious, knowing that the Squibs of the Tongue would expire of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and that 'twas folly to think of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42131:89"/> matters impossible, and no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable, but by a prudent forbearance; he knew the chewing of bitter Pills would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more disgustful: He could contemn unmerited injuries, and requite them with kindness, not retaining a close festering malice in his Breast: He had somewhat of the Ost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches stomach to digest Iron, the climate he lived in required it, and grace enabled him to it. He could leave such injuries to die alone or to repay themselves: And amongst Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streperous Noises could Deafen his Ear, as, tho of a better Spirit and principle, that <hi>Cholerick Satyrus</hi> stop'd his Ear, lest the Bellows of others Tongues should make the Blood Boil in his Veins.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>His Religion.</head>
               <p>He was no Notionist with an Itch after Novelty, or affected singularity; had no rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Prurient Fancy, nor a Coy Squeamish Stomach, as sick men to pingle at the Sawce, or childishly to pick Straws in Divinity. He was endowed with a great Sobriety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Judgment, never so Unchristian as to make all Anti-christian who differed from him, as if none could get to Heaven that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42131:90"/> went not in his Congregational Path: His Religion lay not in an opinion or party, tho he could not be religious without either. He was neither erratick, phrenetick, nor paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. He liked not the lofts of Giddy Heads, had good battlements on his upper story, that he fell not over to break his Bones; time taught him what absurdities overweening, luxuriant, unreined, opinionated fancies ran into: He liked not the torrid Zone, was no Galloper, but went his sober steady pace, being more for Truth than Zeal, yet labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be zealous in Truth. If any <hi>Ethiopian</hi> scratch'd him, Truth was his Salve: Gods Eternal Truth was dearer than Ease, Liberty, or Life, that are in continual Fluxes and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. His Vessel had a good Ballast that he did not tumble, toss or jump up and down by the estuations of flowing and reflowing Waves, in stead of sailing forward to his Heavenly Port.</p>
               <p>His Card, Pole-star, Canon he sailed and walked by was the word of God: The Sun of his daily Life passed through this Zodiack, yet sometimes crossed by the Eccliptick Line. He made this word the man of his Counsel, minding and moving by the Sun rather then the Dial. If he left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road 'twas because fouler and craggy,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42131:90"/> and he espied another clearer and safer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he separated from others, 'twas where they first separated from Truth, knowing that men entring and holding on in a wrong way, have the further to come back with shame, sorrow, and loss of much time. Like the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bred <hi>Bereans</hi> he would enquire at the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, those Divine Oracles, whether those things were so.</p>
               <p>Heaven had giv'n him a competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within himself, that with an easy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity he could not readily be imposed on by the Impostures of a false world. He used his own Legs, not walking on others Crutches, and did not fancy himself nigh Blind to be beholden to others spectacles. That which fixed the Orient Dye, and brightest colour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Religion, was his fixed perseverance: His supernaturalized Soul, followed not the sensible declination of his Body, but in the deadness and barrenness of Nature, he bore fruit in the Autumn and Winter of his Life. His Sun did not as <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s go back, nor as <hi>Joshua</hi>'s stand still, and if at any time a little overcast it soon wrought out. His Caelestial fire never went out, his Lamp was f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with fresh Oyl, and continued as a Green Olive-tree in the House of God. He began with fear, care,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42131:91"/> and labour, travelling after the word, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the light of that word which first awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and illuminated his dark Soul; from a leaden Youth growing to a Golden Age, and not as many from a Golden Youth to a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age; from a day of small things increasing to a day of great things; from an early young Disciple, becoming as <hi>Mnason</hi> an old Disciple, till like <hi>Simeon</hi> with an armful, with an heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Christ he could say, Now, Lord, lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation. 'Tis true he was not what he would be, by the impedings of the flesh, yet was not what he might have been, through the preventings of Grace.</p>
               <p>He was not drunk with opinions, to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and reel to and fro, nor as dying People did he desire the exchange of his Bed and Chamber, but continued his repose in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of that Church, where grace had made him a member. And in all material matters wherein 'twas his duty to be resolved, he had no suspensive hesitancy; he knew not the fall of the Leaf, nor falling sickness that many have been troubled withal, and in case a little short swoun surprized him, the Spirit soon chafed him to Life: If a little straying, the voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, remembred him, here is the way
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42131:91"/> walk in it. His study was not to spend time but to spend it well, to redeem it, that he might spend it better: He took it by the forelock before it turn'd its Bald-pate, endeavouring the witness of some good done before it got out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Time's redemption is a great art, in his journeyings he so contrived affairs that he might way-lay Soul markets in his return. And when hearing he made not idle Indentures on the Table, nor minded he the raptures of a flaming fancy, nor the ringing of Changes or Chimings of words by a loose fancy: 'Twas the necessity, and emprovement, nourishment of his heart he aimed, and not the curiosity of his Ear or Palate.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>His Conversation.</head>
               <p n="1">1. His personal Conversation was to be much at home with his own heart in self-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and heart-examination; if one Eye went abroad for intelligence, the other kept home for application and improvement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with men as glasses wherein to behold his own infirmities, and with Christians as with Books of Receipts, whereby to know his own
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42131:92"/> maladies and cure; making himself another from himself; he was most quick-sighted, and severe at home, calling his Eye home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, reading, hearing nothing but to be enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more Divine observations, and not that for discourse, but practice.</p>
               <p>In Divine matters in reading and hearing he was very sedulous, he saw that nature had hid precious Minerals, not next the skin of the Earth, but deep, and that not because they should not be enjoyed, but that as a witness of their worth, they might be digg'd and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and when cloyed with retirements or other domestick occurrences, he took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of the good Air in some godly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to make an exchange of secular trouble for spiritual cheerings.</p>
               <p>Also as to his personal Conversation, he was much in secret, out of the noise and buz of the world, whose croud he knew might thrust out many a good purpose, and whose bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winds might blow out his Candle. These solitary shades and retirements were not so much to escape the world, but for the more reserved immediate enjoyment of himself with God, and hereby grew the better, the worse he found the world. To be enlarged in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42131:92"/> communion, is the largest dominion, and the best initiating holy souls into heavenly frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to get the sensible feelings, prelibations, and anticipations, Divine prospects and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of supernatural, solacing, ravishing bliss, and joys soon without interruption to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Doubtless Souls familiarized with their God, have the softest days, the sweetest nights, and the largest entrance into the Everlasting Kingdom, readiest for the Bridegroom's call, with their Loins girded, and their Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Abroad men find enveigling vanities; every Port, the Eye, the Ear assaulted with some pleasing temptation, or as it fared with <hi>Lot,</hi> with perplexing vexations.</p>
               <p>These Solitudes and Arbours of holy retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meditations are Gates that let into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World, Heavens Suburbs, and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; Valleys where the hotest Rays strike, where the sugar'd Dews and Drops of Heaven mostly fall, are oft blessed with clearest Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the mind, Exhilarations and sweetest Satisfactions to the affections, and Strengthnings to the wills holy resolutions. Yet 'tis beneath a Christian to be immured in a Monkish Cloister to secure the Castle of Innocency where there are no Assailants, Religion is little concern'd in such sullen Gravities. 'Tis far more noble
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42131:93"/> to be familiar and yet untainted in the throng of the World, where courted with vice, frighted by threats, to sit at a full Table and not to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, whereby the world knows it hath but the Ghost, the Shadow, the worser Half, and God the Main: Those Beasts were clean and fit for divine Sacrifices that chewed the Cud, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Hoof, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Domestick Conversation was pious and profitable. He knew the <hi>Jews</hi> divident of time, for the Law, for Prayer and Work; he missed not our Saviours counsel to the healed Demoniac, <hi>Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, Mark</hi> 5. 19. Nor the practise of <hi>David,</hi> who after his joyful Solemnity about the Ark, return'd to bless his Houshold, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20. Together with the Scripture, he emproved some Books, not many, but choice for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what he read, and this he did not as a task, but out of choice, and as most conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to the Appetite and Palate of his own Soul, as the Air and Element most suitable to graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls to breath in. Doubtless he is the best Christian that is so at home: <hi>Samson</hi> imparted of his Honey taken from the Lions carcase to his Father and Mother. The constant hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Rivolets of Family Prayer and Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sel
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42131:93"/> is as necessary as the great defluxions of a publick Ministry; the watering pot must not be neglected: Who fears not the black brand of an Infidel and worse, that provides not for his Family? When the Sun shines not, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles do well in the night: Though most live in their Families as if they had only Bodies, or rather Beasts to take care of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his Conversation with the Church, he diligently, constantly, even naturally, like <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> cared for the things thereof with singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prudence, and exemplariness, as a sound, able Christian, and almost a Divine, with an assiduous labour to grow in knowledge and grace, and to promote both in others, which was the more effectual, because his actions were no solaecism or contradiction to his profession; this Star is now set, this Pillar taken down, this Stake removed, this Cord broken. You that remain pray that the Lord would enlarge your Tents, and strengthen the Curtains of his Habitation, that he would spare, lengthen your Cords, and strengthen your Stakes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to his Civil, Social Converse: He was choice as to his company; if he went into infected places, he knew his danger, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42131:94"/> like a Physician, designed others Cure: He knew Friends were brittle ware, and that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would with a censorious eye, scan and it may be wrest his words and actions: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chiefly chose company not many, but good, where he might impart or get good, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle his Light with other Stars or Candles, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be one of the Coals that kindle one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to be where he might converse with the God of Spirits, and the Spirits of that God. He knew the difference of Friends and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, was sociable to all, intimate with few: He loved goodness, and good men for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake, was no Raven feeding on others Carcases, nor as Vintners kind to Guests for the sake of a profitable reckoning. His delight was in the Saints, those that excel, to encrease the revenues of his Holy Heart.</p>
               <p>He could commiserate others calamities, grow in wisdom by their follies, in strength by their infirmities, and by their slips stand the stronger.</p>
               <p>He was suspicious of hearing well from ill men, as that <hi>Phocion</hi> commended cryed out, <hi>What evil have I done?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42131:94"/>
               <p> In perplexing, arduous cases he was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, furnished and ready by his long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give advice, and with that practical <hi>Job,</hi> was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and like his Saviour who went up and down doing good, counselling, instructing, and fitted to speak a word in season to weary minds.</p>
               <p>His Ear was a Sanctuary to others matters needing concealment, and had no itch of pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into secrets, by which he might hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or them upon a distast, if Grace preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not. His Eye was quick and faithful in inspecting others Circumstances, and his Tongue impartial in reproving or encouraging as the case required.</p>
               <p>He was social without servility, levity or flattery: Courteous, but not precarious; Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies received were but lent, and doubly repaid; In courtesies bestowed, they were not Baits to Catch Fish withal, he was no singing Wasp, for the Honeys sake frequenting the Sweet Pot.</p>

He was Charitable, Tender-hearted and Ready in his Behaviour towards the Poor: He followed the new Trade of <hi>Tyrus</hi> after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not to hoard up for himself, but for them that dwelt before the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 23. 18. not reckoning himself rich in having goods, but in doing good, esteeming it better to be a Steward than a Treasurer, to lay out, than to lay up, to give, than to get, minding others necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as his own conveniencies, and that 'twas better the World should be his Servant than his Master, and that to trust the Poor with his Estate was the best Usury, and that Riches are not what men possess, but what they use: His perpendicular Rays shined warm on his natural Relations, yet dispersed a benign, charitable Influence, like the Sun, on others at distance; and this he did not for Ostentation, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and in all had a richer heart than hand, out of the competent, comfortable Mediocrity of Estate he was honoured with, not wrapping up his Talent in a Napkin, being ready on all occasions to do what became a good man, and a Christian: Covetousness oft flourisheth in old
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42131:95"/> mens decaying nature, but 'twas dead in him, yet it flourished in his pantings after grace and glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was contented. All fulness is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it makes a perpetual calm, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual feast: He was grateful, not confident in present things, knowing the Bird might take wings and fly away, and that what one Tide brought in another might carry out: And not murmuring or diffident about future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. He esteemed Gods carvings best, and enough; wherein providences were defective, he made a supply in the promises; what he wanted in water, he made up in wine: What he wanted in Bran he made up in Flower. He envied not Superiors who exceeded him, nor Inferiors growing up to equal him: He suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Bladder of his Soul to swell too big; though he had a great Soul, 'twas not for the great things of this World. He could with the Prophet stretch himself to the proportions and commensurations of the Child, if provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences seemed little or low by a gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction he could shrink up himself to their proportion. If he had an envious emulation 'twas divine, in imitating and emulating such as enjoyed mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. He was meek and humble: He knew too big a Sail and Wind was not safe for his Bottom; and therefore rather strove to give honour to God, than to catch it from man, knowing 'twas better to deserve it, than to have it: Anothers brightned Excellencies cast no shade upon him; he pined not, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> at <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, nor was sullen at <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>'s unbended knee: He knew 'twas folly to be swell'd with the course breath and froth of the rustick Rabble, who live like the Eel in Mud, and like Swine upon the Excrements of evil actions. <hi>Padaretus</hi> was pleased the <hi>Spartans</hi> had thirty better Men than he to be Senators. Though a good Name was worth having, he chose rather by good merits to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, than to catch at it: Yet as the Wind blew fair without any hoising his Sails in a greedy desire, he admitted it to serve God and his King and his People: He found the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Obscurity safer than a too free vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary exposure of himself in publick trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</p>

               <p>Death met him nigh at home, whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious necessity he had prevented by the daily resignation of himself to Heavens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Grace was grown to maturity, and like the wombed Child, knocked at Natures doors to entreat the liberty of a larger room in glory: 'Twas his daily task to be doing something good against the good of the last day; every day drawing a Line to make the draught of his eternal fashion glorious: 'Twas his daily endeavour to acquaint himself with that God, and to get the testimonies of his love, with whom he was to live for ever. He lived holily, and died chearfully; Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is bold: Coming to the Iron Gates, they readily opened, and so died with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without any perplexity of mind, or strong pangs in his body, though Nature gave a little short struggle; the last and strongest Siege and Assault was quickly over: Death's Arrow was dipt in the Oil and Honey of Heaven's love, and though he were an homely Messenger, was welcom for his Fathers sake. Death's terrour was supplanted by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42131:97"/> foreseen sequel of joy, the Joys of Heaven, that through the very flames of Hell, holy Souls would run unto: He well knew the conflicting Life he was parting with, and the triumphing Life he should unalterably and eternally be possessed of. Having like <hi>David</hi> served his Generation, and done the office of a faithful Steward, his Audit day was welcome, for his honourable discharge, Well done, good and faithful Servant: From the time of his first return to God, and Faith in his unchangeable Love, though at some time corruption gave him trouble, yet for about forty years his Ship was never driven from its Anchors, but he retained his hope without any unraveling or unbottoming doubts, and in the last year of his Life was much solacing his Soul in the fore-views of future Glory, much reading that piece of his Ancient Reverend Pastor Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> about the Glory of Christ in his Person, Office and Grace.</p>
               <p>Thus having Fought the Good Fight, Run his Race, Finished his Course upon Earth, having oft fetch'd his God down to him, he was taken up to his God.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Keep up an honourable esteem of Religion and a Religious, Pious Life, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to know and practise the Will of God, and to bind thy self Servant to that Heavenly Lord and Master: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a <hi>relegendo,</hi> that whereby the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Law comes to be writ and read again in mans heart and life, or a <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando,</hi> renouncing sin to have your heart knit again to God, or a <hi>re-eligendo,</hi> from making a new choice of God and his work; nothing is more honourable: The Soul of true Nobility consists in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind endowed with divine qualities, and laudable actions, that creates an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance to the glorious God, and enables to live the life of God on earth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to live an ever-blessed life with God in Heaven.

            <p n="6">6. Take heed of sinful beginnings. The stream small at the Spring-head at distance swells into a great River: The Sea from a small breach overflows with an uncontrouled violence: The Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tyrant though pretending fair usage, being entred with a small party, after pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of all, falls to his merciless outrages: The stone beginning to roll from the Mountains top stayeth not till at bottom: Lesser dalliances pass on to repeated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42131:106"/> sin cannot be kept at staves end, but from little dissolutions will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernibly prevail to licentious intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances: The Winter comes on with gentle cold Dews, till it claps on its Iron Frosts, and puts forth its full force to the imprisoning of Natures strength and glory. If sin and sinners get you one Mile, they will get you to two, till they have gotten you to the brink, even into the midst or Hell, getting thy Coat they will get thy Cloak also. If they take their Breakfast with thee they will stay till Dinner, till Supper, and lodge with thee: This <hi>Austin</hi> found, <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat me non esse impudentem,</hi> he stop'd not till he became bold and impudent in sinning. One Game brings on another to midnight, to morning: Lesser Cups and Sippings bring on to Bowls and larger Draughts. The Flood of sin and punishment came upon the old World by drops. <hi>Peccatum aggreditur, ingreditur, progreditur, persicitur:</hi> Sin spreads like a Gangrene or Canker that begins with a little black speck: None leap into the heights of sin or depths of Hell at once, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.

At first men are at the Counsel of the ungodly, an internal forge, then in the way of sinners, then in the seat of the scornful. Therefore however mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and mannerly sin, Satan, or sinners be at first, <hi>Principiis obsta,</hi> stop at first, and a positive denial once given, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be less busy, or less preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Shun bad Company. They are Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters, a thing so precious that people would redeem with the price of the whole world: They are Estate-consumers, and Soul-poysoners. Your Father hath left you a competent Estate, not to enable you with fuel to be the more sinful, but that you may be the more free and able to serve your Maker: 'Tis pitty wit and wealth should be vilely cast away. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Enter not into the path of wicked men.</hi> 13. and 20. <hi>A companion of fools shall be destroyed.</hi> Sin is a catching dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, many ingenuous Natures have been Metamorphosed, and hopeful, gracious tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures discoloured and worn off by bad
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42131:107"/> Companions: Can they be Friends to you who are Enemies to God, and their own Souls? <hi>Cicero</hi> said, <hi>he had rather have no Companion than a bad one:</hi> The most of worldly Friendship is managed with Enmity to God, with infractions on his Law, with a reproach to Religion, with wounds to Conscience, and murther to Souls: 'Tis better being sober and going to Heaven alone, than to go to Hell for Company and Fashion sake: If they say, <hi>You a Gentleman with an Estate carry it like a fool?</hi> If thou be the Worlds fool, you will be Gods wiseman: Who loseth a Princes favour for a Beggars? Or the Judges for a Malefactors? What are their smiles, if God frowns? <hi>Dives</hi> was afraid his Brethren should come to his Hell to encrease his torment. <hi>Zenophanes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himself a coward to ignoble chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges.</p>
            <p>Is it Mirth in the exercises of Wit to puff and toss about an alternate Jest, whereby with many Religion and religious Persons are made a scoff? Whoever is in the dance, the Devil is Fidler to make the mirth.</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:42131:107"/>
            <p> Is it manlike bravery to strive who shall spend most, and drink the greatest draughts? Where lest the Cup should not overflow, our Gallants squeeze in the Blood of their Souls, as of their Estates and Reputation, to make a Drink Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Devil.</p>
            <p>Is this Valour to Curse and Swear, and strive for the biggest Oaths fetch'd many miles deep out of Hell? Men provoked, in wrath Swear and will be avenged on God and their Souls. 'Tis for Oaths the Land mourneth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 10. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 3. And into the House and Heart of the Swearer will the curse come, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 3. How in distress can the Swearer call upon God, whose name he hath blasphemed? How at Death shall he appear to his Judgment? After his horrid invocations of Divine Vengeance in his ordinary swearing.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Isaac,</hi> your education and hopeful ingenuity promise better things from you. However set God before you; and be in his fear in all Places, in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>

In your endeavour for Learning, get to the Throne of Grace for Grace, that you and that may be sanctified, else the strong tides of sin and errour may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear you: The dead Fish are carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Stream: Sinister ends, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal influences, and overawings may bring you on to make an hopeful beginning, but 'tis only a gracious fixed temper of mind will persevere you. Hot exhalations are check'd back by the Cold middle Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Much Corn and many sweet Blooms are stryed in the setting; excellent notions about Divine Objects are ineffective, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less those Idea's of Glory, be imprinted on the Soul, and be transmitted, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commanded unto the will and affections by them to be embraced with Love, to ingenerate a vital transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Be studious, nothing is more congenial to the Nature and Appetite of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing than knowledge; for this <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> prayed: A Book is a better Ornament than an Hawk or Hound; if delving in the Mines be tedious, the Golden reward
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42131:108"/> makes amends; difficulty is in the Agent not in the Work, get Love and all will be easie: A Schollar cannot be uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table who hath intellectual Beauties to gaze on, and self repositories and stores to delight in.</p>
            <p>Above all beg Grace. Court not the Hand maid for the Mistriss, the Glittering Lace for the precious Garment. One cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Quantus artifex pereo? What a great Schollar is going to Hell? Quid prodest peritum esse &amp; periturum?</hi> What avails it, to be learned and cursed. 'Tis Grace that Gift of God, as the Altar, that Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gold, and makes all conducible to Salvation. <hi>Veritatem Philosophia quaerit, Theologia invenit, Religio possidet;</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy seeks Truth, Divinity findeth it, Religion possesseth it; Grace bless you with it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Frequently call to mind the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and the practice of your Pious Father, how Praying how Reading, how Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, and imitate all, that he, though dead may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
